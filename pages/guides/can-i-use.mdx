# What components or page templates can I use?

When Figma documentation for a `WPL` component or page template is complete, the design will be labeled with a status. The purpose of this status is to communicate to designers whether a component is safe to use.

## Ready for use

<br />
<Image
  src="/images/VersionStatus-Ready@2x.png"
  alt="Hello"
  width={186}
  height={56}
/>

`WPL` components and page templates labeled "Ready for use" are available and aligned in both Figma and [Swingset](https://react-components.vercel.app/).

## Work-in-progress

<br />
<Image
  src="/images/VersionStatus-WIP@2x.png"
  alt="Hello"
  width={235}
  height={56}
/>

`WPL` components or page templates labeled "Work-in-progress" is active work not final in Figma or [Swingset](https://react-components.vercel.app/).
Components or page templates are considered "Work-in-progress" if:

- In design
- In development
- In review

## Archived

<br />
<Image
  src="/images/VersionStatus-Archived@2x.png"
  alt="Hello"
  width={135}
  height={56}
/>

`WPL` components or page templates labeled as "Archived" are no longer available in Figma or [Swingset](https://react-components.vercel.app/). **Archived components or page templates should not be used.**
