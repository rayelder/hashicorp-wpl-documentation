# How should I name a branch?

Branch names should communicate:

- Who created (or owns) the branch
- The branch's type of work
- The branch's scope of work

### Examples:

- `re.wip.update-homepage-hero`
- `team.archive.button-component`

### Formula:

`author` + `.` + `type` + `.` + `description`

---

#### Author

The branch author can be `author_initials` or `team`. Use a period to seperate `author` from `description`.

#### Type

Prefix the branch name to quickly identify the type of work.

- `archive` = Archived
- `wip` = Work-in-progress

#### Description

The `description` of work should be concise. Use hyphens to separate up to 3-5 words. Lead with a present tense verb.

---

#### Reminders

1. Use lowercase
2. Use a period to seperate `author` and `type` from `description`
3. Use hyphens to separate `description` words
4. **Don't stress!** You can always rename a branch after it is created

---

### Notes

> If you donâ€™t have a current naming convention for design work, one thing that I like to recommend is talking with your development partners to see what type of conventions they use. If there's an opportunity to align and use the same conventions, it can help streamline communication across the entire process!

_The use of lowercase, periods, and hyphens mirrors current conventions used by engineering._

**Important:** You cannot branch a branch in Figma.
